## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

- Validate restaurant geocodes in the shared location helper; only precise business or numbered street-address matches may become pins, never city centroids or partial matches.
- Resolve recommendation pins through server-only Google Places business search; validate the business name, city, and coordinates in the shared location helper rather than trusting AI addresses.
- Restaurant searches and autocomplete are public without sign-in; keep paid API credentials server-only and preserve cross-site request protection, six-result caps, name deduplication, and concurrency at six or below.
- Cache only validated, independently generated AI matches in a server-only database table with hashed normalized keys and expiry; refresh Google location data per search and fail open on cache errors to preserve availability.
